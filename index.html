            iii. “It’s never too late to be what you might have been.”
            
            iv. “You don’t have to be great to start. "But you have to start to be great.”
            
            v. “You may see me struggle but you will never see me quit.” 
            
            vi. “Successful people are not gifted. They just work hard, then succeed on purpose.” 
            
            vii. “The people who are crazy enough to believe they can change the world are the ones who do.” 
            
            viii.“All the water in the sea can’t sink a ship unless it gets inside the ship. Similarly, all the negativity in the world can’t get you down unless you allow it inside you.”
